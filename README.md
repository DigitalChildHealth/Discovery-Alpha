# Discovery-Alpha
Discovery and alpha work is being carried out by NHS Digital in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, to inform robust and viable national interop and failsafe services to enable Digital Child Health.

This respository holds information to support this work.

The approach to the work is based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" target="_blank">GOV.UK Service Manual</a> agile delivery. This defines two initial phases of discovery and alpha.

## Discovery Phase
Given that <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/healthy-children-transforming-child-health-info.pdf" target="_blank">Healthy Children: Transforming Child Health Information</a> has already involved extensive consultation and user research, the discovery phase will be focused on elaborating and consulting on key requirements (business, functional and technical), where needed. It will not involve any service design or user journey mappings.
The outputs delivered will be:

1. A comprehensive document that articulates key requirement decisions and elaborations, with appropriate explanatory narratives.

## Alpha Phase
The alpha phase, as defined in GOV.UK Service Manual, will include:

*	Build prototypes of your service
*	Test your prototypes with users
*	Demonstrate that the service you want to build is technically possible

For the purposes of the alpha work, users will be considered to be suppliers of systems who will be child events publishers and/or subscribers.
The outputs delivered will be:

1.	One or more prototypes
2.	Documented evaluations of the prototypes from both business and technical viewpoints
3.	A recommendation, with supporting evidence, of which prototype, if any, is the best viable option to progress to beta phase

## Ways of working
**Open to all** - Opportunity for supplier and user communities to become involved to both influence and learn.

**Contribution** - Seeking different levels of involvement:

* Doers -  suppliers and users who are willing to get their hands dirty trying out aspects of the interop and failsafe. We would really like at least one primary care, CHIS and ePCHR supplier to be involved.
* Thinkers – suppliers and users who are willing to publically offer views, advice or critiques.
* Watchers – suppliers and users who just want to follow progress.

**Transparency** - All discussions, communications and points of view contributed by suppliers and users will be openly available online.
