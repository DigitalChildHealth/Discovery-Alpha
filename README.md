# Discovery-Alpha
To inform a robust and viable national interop service to support Digital Child Health, discovery and alpha work is being carried out by NHS Digital in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders.

This respository holds information to support this work.

The approach to the work will be based on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" target="_new">GOV.UK Service Manual</a> agile delivery. This defines two initial phases of discovery and alpha.

## Discovery Phase
Given that <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/healthy-children-transforming-child-health-info.pdf" target="_new">Healthy Children: Transforming Child Health Information</a> has already involved extensive consultation and user research, the discovery phase will be focused on elaborating and consulting on key requirements (business, functional and technical), where needed. It will not involve any service design or user journey mappings.
The outputs delivered will be:

1. A comprehensive document that articulates key requirement decisions and elaborations, with appropriate explanatory narratives.

## Alpha Phase
The alpha phase, as defined in GOV.UK Service Manual, will include:

*	Build prototypes of your service
*	Test your prototypes with users
*	Demonstrate that the service you want to build is technically possible

For the purposes of the alpha works, users will be considered to be suppliers of systems who will be publishers and/or subscribers of child events.
The outputs delivered will be:

1.	One or more prototypes
2.	Documented evaluations of the prototypes from both business and technical viewpoints
3.	A recommendation, with supporting evidence, of which prototype, if any, is the best viable option to progress to beta phase
4.	Documented design of the best viable option, in sufficient detail to support approvals by architecture governance
